# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
This repository contains a project aimed at detecting credit card fraud using machine learning techniques implemented in Python. The project utilizes a variety of algorithms to analyze and classify transactions as either legitimate or fraudulent. Key features include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, model training, and evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The dataset used is highly imbalanced, and techniques like SMOTE are employed to handle this challenge. The goal is to build a robust and efficient model to aid in the early detection of fraudulent transactions.
